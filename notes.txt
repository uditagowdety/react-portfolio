shit thats not working
- why is the nav bar so thin
- color on hover isnt reflecting [resolved, forgot to add :hover]
- why can't i change the font T_T
- why is my header not perfectly centered in the screen !!!!????


- it must be some selector that every single subsection in main shares. container? grid? what else? section?

things that work < 992 is because some parent container's property gets overwritten by the properties in the media query (i think)
